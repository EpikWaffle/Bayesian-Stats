# Bayesian-Stats
A collection of the homeworks and labs I completed for my Bayesian Statistics (MATH 347) class at Vassar College

I took this class spring semester of sophomore year (January 2019 - May 2019). 

I had 0 prior experience with R before this class so my first one or two homeworks/labs probably look a little rough.
